A young woman named Belle, who longs for more than her provincial life, sacrifices her freedom to save her father by living with a cursed Beast in his enchanted castle. Over time, she looks beyond his monstrous exterior and discovers the kindness and humanity within him. Their growing love breaks the spell that had trapped him and his servants, showing that true beauty lies not in appearance, but in the heart.
